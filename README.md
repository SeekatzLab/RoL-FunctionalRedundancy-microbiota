Abstract:
Dietary habits have dramatically altered over recent decades, yet the impact of simplified carbohydrate intake on the gut microbiome’s complexity and function remains poorly understood. This study investigates how the variety of dietary carbohydrates—not just their amount—shapes gut microbial diversity and resilience in C57BL/6 mice. Over eight weeks, mice consumed diets varying in carbohydrate complexity but matched for total carbohydrate content. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found that reduced carbohydrate diversity led to significant declines in microbial diversity and taxonomic redundancy among important bacterial groups, such as unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Muribaculaceae, despite no immediate changes in host physiology. Concurrently, Akkermansia increased under low-complexity diets, suggesting a shift toward mucin degradation when complex polysaccharides are scarce. These changes indicate that loss of carbohydrate complexity narrows microbial niches, potentially disrupting metabolic interactions and functional stability of the gut ecosystem. Given the widespread adoption of processed, low-fiber diets in modern societies, these findings emphasize the importance of macronutrient complexity in maintaining gut microbial health. While short-term host effects were minimal, the microbial shifts observed could presage long-term consequences for gut resilience and disease susceptibility. This study underscores the need to consider carbohydrate diversity in dietary recommendations and microbial ecology research to safeguard gut health in the face of global dietary simplification.

One-word summary:
Decreasing carbohydrate diversity alone (independent of carbohydrate ratio) can influence gut microbiota diversity and taxonomic redundancy.
